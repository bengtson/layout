# Layout

The Layout module helps solve some of the difficulties in creating charts and graphs. It provides an easy approach to defining the various parts of charts such as axis, plot area, gridlines, titles, etc.

A layout is simply a list of each chart area in one direction. For an X/Y chart, two layouts can be used to define the structure of the chart. Take for example creating an SVG chart showing lake levels (Y) by month (X). The elements of this chart in the x direction might consist of the following parts:

  - a left margin between the left edge of the SVG and the start of the chart.
  - an area that will show the title of the y-axis with text rotated 90Â°.
  - an area for the display of the labels for each gridline in the chart.
  - the plot area for the lake level data
  - a right margin between the right edge of the SVG and the right of the chart.

With a well defined width of the chart, the widths of each area could be specified and then used for drawing text, labels, ticks, gridlines and data. However, it becomes difficult to make all the changes should the canvas be sized differently or if other chart parameters need to change.

Here's an example of how to setup a Layout for the horizontal direction in the chart above. Let's assume that the width of the SVG canvas is going to be 800. The Layout generation might look something like this.

    layout =
      Layout.create("chart horizontal", 800)
      |> Layout.add("left margin", 2.0)
      |> Layout.add("y axis title", 10.0)
      |> Layout.add("y axis labels", 20.0)
      |> Layout.add("plot area", 75.0)
      |> Layout.add("right margin", 2.0)
      |> Layout.resolve

The code shows the creation of a layout with a layout name and the width of the canvas that will be used. This is followed by layout elements defined by the chart designer. Each element has a name and a relative length (width for the horizontal layout in this example). The specified widths are relative and are determined by their ratio in the total of the relative widths. This makes it easy to change the width of a single element without redistributing the width in other elements. In this case, the total relative widths add up to 109.0. This means, for example, that the "plot area" will be 75.0/109 or 69% of the total chart width.

The 'resolve' function traverses the layout and assigns starting points and lengths to each of the elements based on the width of the canvas and the relative lengths of each element.

'layout' will contain the information about the layout and all it's elements.

Now assume the 3-letter month abbreviations need to be placed under the plot area with each centered with space provided for the month. A simple Affine map can be generated that easily provides position information for each of the month names. Generation of the transform is as follows:

    x_map = Layout.transform layout, "plot area", -0.5, 12

An Affine map is returned that will let the user know the center position for the months as follows:

    jan_pos = Affine.map x_map, 0
    sep_pos = Affine.map x_map, 9

These values are the x position in the SVG space that should be used for writing the centered test.

The Layout handles all the calculations to determine the start point and width of the plot area and the Affine map automatically 'maps' the start and length information to the area.

Of course, a second layout needs to be generated for the vertical elements of the chart but this is done using the same method as the vertical. When done, plotting data is as easy as using the x_map and y_map to move from the data space to the canvas space.

See also the `scalar` module that can be used to automatically generate x and y scales, tick marks and gridlines based on the data to be plotted.
